**Paper 1 Classic Autoencoder**
Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, Science 2006)

**Idea**: Train a neural net to compress and reconstruct data.
**Learning**: Basic encoderâ€“decoder structure, latent representation, reconstruction loss (MSE).
**Implementation**: Train on MNIST
